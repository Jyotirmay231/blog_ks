                <h2> <b> First Day ....</b></h2> <br>
                <p>This was the first day we both meet each other in the Inter-house sports match practice. It was Sunday morning when after finishing our practice, we all our house mates sit together in the grounds and talk to each other. Suddenly a sound came from the back and then she start talking to me. Till now i doesn't notice that <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">she was in our house team loll... It was very small conversion. Then we start doing our throwbball practice again. After then they all rush to their hostel. After then my friend came to me and he say that he start liking a girl from our house, then i ask her name. He said that her name is Ishita (Fake name given for this blog), it was the same girl then i agree with him ok lets try it. my friend ayush(fake name of friend for this story) he was a day scholar student but he was staying in our room in hostel hiding from the warden. At night we start discussing how to approach ishita, suddenly she follow me in instagram and i follow back her. Then from her side she texted me that <b>hy...are you from house.</b> In my mind i just think that is she fool, in morning we all do practice togethen and in night she just asked me that "are you from same house" loll... Simply i just told her that no i am from another house loll... Her reaction wass ooo.. then i tell her that no i am from same house and all tell him that "next day came early for practice and Good night" and also ask her that if you have no problem then you can give me your number so that i can call you if you doesn't come in morning for practics. She give me her both the number. After this i message that this was my number. After some time of chatting with each other, its was the end of our conversion for that day. Simply from Good night and Take care the chats ended. After sometime i started tasing ayush that she follow me and his reaction was like you tension not she does not message you bro, i was like "bro i already talked to her" loll.. it was very funny moment. After that i go to sleep. <br><b>Good night</b></span></p>

                <p>Another Day start.... wake up at morning 5:00 am for go to practice. While doing to practice i have one thing in my find, "what happens when my mother came to know that <span id="dots2">...</span> <span id="more2">now i am a good boy, I wake up at 5:00 am. She will be like <b>"you never wake early when you are at home" loll..."</b> ". Getting back to real life i and my friend bunty reach the ground and see that there was no one here. Then i call Ishita and tell her to come to ground immediately with all her friends and also with seniors. After completing our practice she went off. Then we went off to room also. Today is the intresting day.With the help of any girl ayush take ishita in conference call and ask her number but she just said brother to ayush. Lolll... After this incident she call me and tell the whole story, we just laughed together. I don't know why but i loved to talk to her.She was really a nice girl. We start talking in call from day to midnight. She was little bit crazy type girl, the more and more i talk to her, the closer i go with her. late night talk end and we both go to sleep. <br> <b>Good night</b> </span></p>

                <p><b>My remaining whole december month</b></p>
                <p>For the whole month i get closer to her. The more i talk, more i start loving her. I started doing flirt with her but i was also scared that if she <span id="dots3">...</span> <span id="more3">started feeling angry and start ignoring me, so i do my flirt in limited order. Most of my friends started teasing her by my name, but i don't know why she doesn't say them anything. Is she started liking me ? Dont know what happen now. One day after practice she sits quite in the ground, my bestie came and sit near to him as we are senior to ishita, my bestie ask her to call me brother. But she didn't call me brother. Now i was very exited to propose her, but other side i am also scared. I don't know why at that time i scared to talk to girl face to face but in call you can talk with me whole day. But till this time she have an idea that i like her. While talking with her i proposed her many times but when she getting it serious i started doing comedy. lol... why i am so foolish. But then i decided that whatever happens, now i seriously proposing her. The next day was New year. 2022 is starting from midnight.Now lets go to sleep and wake in another year lolll.... <br> <b>Good night</b> </p></span>
